# Anthropocene Game
2D Platformer game 

Author:Naman Kanwar
## Inspiration
I am really interested into game development so this is the first platformer game that I made after making a self difficulty raising version of pong. This game shows the importance of nature in our life. As we (humans) are moving closer to a complete technology based society we are losing touch with nature.

## What it does
The game portrays that as we are improving technologically, we are destroying nature!

## How I built it
I built this game using Game Maker and some sprites that I was either able to find and change around or create my own sprites

## Challenges I ran into
I was following tutorials that could not teach me how to debug my code due to the customization I had in my code. There were times when I thought about giving up. But, I didn't give up and kept trying new approaches to the best of my ability. As a result I was able to debug /develop about 75% of the game in three days of my Thanks Giving Break!      
  
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was able to debug the code by myself 

## What we learned
I learned a lot about C++ and Game Maker. I also learned about some methods of debugging and understood the basic physics concepts in game development   

## What's next for Anthropocene
I want to make the project more complex by adding more levels 

## Built With
C++, Game Maker
